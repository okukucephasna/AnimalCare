# AnimalCare – Animal Treatment App for Farmers

!\[visitor badge] License: GPL v3

**AnimalCare** is a mobile application designed to empower farmers by providing simple, fast, and accessible animal treatment advice—without needing to wait for a veterinary officer. In many rural areas, veterinary services are limited or delayed, which can put animal health at serious risk. AnimalCare helps bridge that gap by giving farmers actionable remedies and treatment tips based on common symptoms.
